# Project Name: Titanic Data Analysis and Machine Learning

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset, performing data cleaning and visualization, manipulating features, and training several machine learning models to predict survival outcomes of Titanic passengers. The models used for training include logistic regression (perceptron), decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, and AdaBoost classifier. The models are evaluated based on accuracy and score metrics, and then tested using the testing dataset. Additionally, grid search and cross-validation techniques are employed for model optimization and performance assessment.

## Project Overview

The Titanic Data Analysis and Machine Learning project focuses on understanding the Titanic dataset and building machine learning models to predict the survival chances of passengers based on various features. The project involves several stages, including loading and exploring the dataset, data analysis and cleaning, data visualization, feature manipulation, training of different machine learning models, model evaluation, testing, grid search, and cross-validation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their personal details and survival outcomes. The dataset is typically split into a training set and a testing set, where the training set is used for model training and the testing set is used for model evaluation and testing.

## Project Workflow

The project follows the following workflow:

1. Loading and exploring the dataset: The dataset is loaded into the project, and an initial exploration is performed to gain insights into its structure and contents.

2. Data analysis and cleaning: The dataset is analyzed to identify missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies. Data cleaning techniques are applied to handle these issues and ensure the dataset is suitable for further analysis.

3. Data visualization: Various visualization techniques are used to better understand the relationships between different features and their impact on survival outcomes.

4. Manipulating the features: Feature engineering techniques such as one-hot encoding and binning are applied to transform categorical or continuous features into a suitable format for the machine learning models.

5. Training machine learning models: Six types of machine learning models, including logistic regression (perceptron), decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, and AdaBoost classifier, are trained using the prepared dataset.

6. Evaluating the models: The trained models are evaluated based on accuracy and score metrics to assess their performance and compare their effectiveness.

7. Testing the models: The best-performing models are tested using the testing dataset to assess their generalization and predictive capabilities.

8. Grid search: Grid search technique is applied to tune the hyperparameters of the models for optimal performance.

9. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is performed to assess the models' performance on multiple subsets of the data and ensure their reliability.

## Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning models are utilized in this project:

- Logistic regression (perceptron)
- Decision tree
- Support vector machine (SVM)
- Random forest classifier
- Gradient boosting classifier
- AdaBoost classifier

These models are chosen for their ability to handle classification tasks and their potential to provide accurate predictions based on the given dataset.

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- Score: Provides a metric to

 rank the models based on their performance.

These metrics help in assessing the models' predictive capabilities and comparing their effectiveness.

## Testing and Validation

After evaluating the models, the best-performing models are tested using the testing dataset. This step helps in assessing the models' generalization and their ability to predict survival outcomes for unseen data.

## Optimization

To optimize the models' performance, grid search technique is employed. It involves searching for the best combination of hyperparameters for each model, fine-tuning the models for improved accuracy and predictive power.
